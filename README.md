`Section`: BSIT 302- A

## About
Put here the description and general instructions of the exercise.

## Files Structure

main-branch 
index.html
```

## Challenges Encountered
I had some difficulty remembering the correct HTML keywords and syntax, like using <strong>, <br>, and properly structuring the table. Making the table with rowspan and colspan was tricky at first.  

## Key Takeaways
I learned how important it is to use the right HTML syntax and keywords. I also learned how to create tables, organize content, and build a basic webpage that can later become a professional portfolio.
